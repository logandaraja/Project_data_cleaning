The data set was on recognizing human activities using smartphone. The raw form of the original data set was obtained from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip]. The experiment has been carried out using 30 volunteers performing six different activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) while wearing smart phone which recorded 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The clean data file names clean_data_project_q5.txt has 68 columns  that capture the required values of predictor variables and the acuity. We will summarize the description of each column in the data. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer was recorded. The mean value of decomposed value along three axes X,Y and Z are recorded. For brevity we denote Axes to refer to one of the tree axes X, Y or Z.

* Subject: denote a code for a volunteer (1 through 30)

* Mean_value_of tBodyAcc_mean_Axes:  here the exes means one of X, Y or Z. This represent the average value of the tBodyAcc_mean_Axes for the subject performing the given activity. For example, the data was recorded when subject was WALKING for several times, say 90.
